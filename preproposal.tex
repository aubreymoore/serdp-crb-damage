\section{Objective}

\textit{The proposed objectives and how the project is responsive to the objectives
	articulated in the SON.}\\
	
Our objective is to develop an automated remote sensing system that detects, quantifies and monitors coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) damage on isolated Pacific islands using artificial intelligence (AI) to scan georeferenced digital images. This system will use images acquired from several sources, including roadside surveys, aerial drone surveys and the worldwide web.

This proposal addresses the statement of need (SON) entitled \textit{Advancing Non-Indigenous Invasive Species Surveillance, Mitigation, or Biosecurity Measures Affecting Military Readiness in the Indo-Pacific Region}. The objective of this SON "is to solicit proposals that develop and mature the science to detect, survey, mitigate, characterize impacts, and minimize the establishment or spread of invasive species in the Indo-Pacific region".
	
Our goal is to provide a flexible toolkit of standardized, cost-effective CRB surveillance methods which can be used on any Pacific island for CRB surveillance to provide early detection, delimitation of new populations, and routine monitoring as part of eradication and control programs. 

\section{Background}

\todo[inline]{Add bibitems for citations in this section}

\textit{Sufficient technical background to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the problem and frame the proposed research in the context of the current state of the science or technology.}\\

Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), \textit{Oryctes rhinoceros}, is one of the most problematic invasive species in the Indo-Pacific region. This beetle is endemic to the tropical Asia region (including South East Asia). CRB damages both coconut and oil palm, and is capable of killing palms when adults bore into crowns to feed on sap \cite{Bedford2013a, Bedford2013b}. For general information on CRB and response guidelines for Pacific islands invaded by this pest please see \cite{Pallipparambil2015,Jackson2020,Moore2023}. 

These new tools will supplement detection and monitoring of CRB populations in conjunction with other other surveillance methods including pheromone trapping REF and E-DNA sampling currently being developed by a SERDP project REF. For island-wide roadside surveys on Guam, we estimate an annual cost of \$X for automated damage surveys and \$X for pheromone trapping. 

\subsection{Invasion history of CRB in the Pacific}

The beetle was inadvertently introduced into the Pacific in 1909 when infested rubber tree plants were transported to Samoa from Sri Lanka (previously known as Ceylon) \cite{Catley1969}. The pest rapidly multiplied in Samoa and subsequently spread to several nearby Polynesian islands. Separate invasions further distributed CRB through Palau, parts of Papua New Guinea, and other Pacific nations through disruptions and uncontrolled movements during World War II \cite{Catley1969,Gressitt1953}. The invasive phase of the beetle was brought under control by the discovery and distribution of a viral biocontrol agent, \textit{Oryctes rhinoceros} nudivirus (OrNV). OrNV is currently present and causes persistent population suppression on many of the CRB infested Pacific Islands \cite{Bedford2013b,Huger2005}. Virus introduction into affected Pacific Island countries and territories suppressed and weakened the CRB populations such that its spread into the Pacific islands ceased and for 30 years there was no further range expansion of CRB \cite{Vaqalo2015}. 

However, the situation changed. Since the beginning of in 2007, CRB has invaded six islands north of the equator (Table \ref{tbl:north}) and six islands south of the equator (Table \ref{tbl:south}). Most of these populations are resistant to biologocal control using OrNV \cite{Marshall2017}. There is an urgent need to develop cost-efficient, standardized survey methods for early detection, delimitation, and mapping levels of CRB damage on Pacific islands which have been invaded or at a risk of being invaded.

\subsection{CRB damage survey methods}

V-shaped cuts to palm fronds (Fig. \ref{fig:vcuts}) and other symptoms of CRB adult feeding activity are highly distinctive and visible from up to a few hundred meters.

A review of CRB damage survey methods is provided by Mansfield et al. 2023 \cite{Mansfield2023}. Originally, surveyors recorded direct visual observations but recent surveys almost always use georeferenced digital images. Severity of damage to palms in these images is later classified by human experts using a standardized 3-level scale (undamaged, damaged, dead) or a 5-level scale (undamaged, low damage, medium damage, high damage, dead). Results are then displayed on maps. 

\subsection{Automation of CRB damage surveys}

On Guam, CRB damage surveys have been automated in three ways:
Images are not taken by a human, but are taken by a smart phone camera which snaps photos at a rate of one per second and records GPS coordinates;
Coconut palms in each image are located, assigned a damage level, and are scanned for v-shaped cuts by AI object detectors;
Location of coconut palms and damage levels are automatically added to an interactive web map.
This allows us to complete a damage survey of Guam within the few hours it takes to drive all the major roads on the island in both directions.

\subsection{Images of CRB damage on the world-wide-web}

Images of coconut palms with probable CRB damage are publicly available on the world-wide-web. Some of these are the result of citizen science projects initiated specifically to detect CRB damage, such as \href{https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/retired-fa-15-uog-crb-damage-survey}{an iNaturalist project entitled \textit{FA 15 UOG CRB Damage Survey}} and a \href{https://www.projectnoah.org/missions/182566002}{Project Noah mission entitled \textit{Help Save Hawaii's Coconut Trees}}.

In addition, there are many unlabeled images of coconut palms available as incidental images within social media and elsewhere on the world-wide-web and new images are being added daily. Paudel and Jackson have been tracking potential biosecurity incursions using publicly available images on the web \cite{Paudel2023} and have discovered strong evidence that CRB has invaded Mexico \cite{Jackson2022}.

We intend to apply our object detectors to automate searches for CRB damage in publicly available images on the web.

\subsection{Previous work on automated CRB damage surveys}
\label{previous_work}
The proposed project builds on an existing system which maps CRB damage using automated analysis of ground-based imagery which uses a smart phone mounted on a road vehicle for data acquisition. Currently, images are taken at a rate of one per second by a free cell phone app named OpenCamera. Each image is 1920 x 1080 pixels in size and GPS coordinates are embedded within the image file. Note that the phone does not require a SIM card or internet connection during data acquisition. 

After transferring image files to a laptop computer, each is examined by a pair of object detectors trained by an artificial intelligence technique called deep learning. One detector puts a bounding box around all coconut palms within each image and assigns a standardized 5-scale damage index to each palm [REF]. The damage index is based on a standard methodology developed by CRB experts working on islands in the south Pacific [REF]. A second object detector counts v-shaped cuts to coconut palm in fronds which are distinctive signs of CRB feeding damage. Results are visualized using interactive web maps. This ground-based system has been used for routine roadside surveys on Guam and has also been used for early detection of CRB damage on Rota in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and on Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands [REFS].

For details on this ground-based CRB damage survey methodology see the attached file roadside.pdf.

We will improve the existing ground-based system and adapt this system to use aerial drone imagery to facilitate:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CRB damage detection over large areas of remote, otherwise inaccessible, terrain
	\item early detection and delimiting surveys in rapid response projects on islands where CRB has not yet established, increasing chances of eradication
	\item monitoring temporal and spatial changes in CRB damage on islands where CRB has	established
	\item measuring changes in CRB damage in response to biological control, sanitation, and other mitigation tactics
\end{itemize}

\section{Approach}

\textit{The technical approach and methods, preferably structured in hypothesis-driven tasks that clearly identify how the objectives of the proposed project will be addressed. This section should be the primary focus of the pre-proposal.}

\paragraph{Design features.} All code will be developed using free open-source software (FOSS) and all code, data and documentation generated by the project will be made available via public GitHub repositories. Methods will be designed to be appropriate for use on Pacific islands which have  limited technical and financial resources.

\paragraph{Object detectors.} Existing object detectors, which have been used in roadside CRB damage surveys on Guam since 2020, will be retrained to minimize false positives and false negatives. Performance before and after retraining will be evaluated using standard metrics and reported in a technical report. A user manual for the object detectors will be provided. 

\paragraph{Roadside surveys.} Improved object detectors will be tested in ongoing quarterly CRB damage surveys on Guam using \hyperref[previous_work]{methods detailed above}. Combined roadside and drone surveys will be performed on Majuro. 

\paragraph{Aerial drone surveys.} Object detectors will be retrained to detect CRB from the air. A high quality dataset of drone imagery acquired on Guam specifically for this purpose is available in a public GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/aubreymoore/crb-vdc}. An initial field trial of the drone survey methodology will be conducted on Guam. Technical documentation and a user guide for the aerial drone survey methodology will be written. Operational testing be performed on Majuro.

\paragraph{World wide web surveys.}

Our object detectors can process images acquired from any source, including world-wide-web. In an automated scan of iNaturalist observations from Mexico, our v-shaped cut detector found coconut palms with CRB damage symptoms (Fig. \ref{fig:crb-mexico}), corroborating evidence of a CRB population in Mexico from manual searches of social media images by Jackson and Paudel \cite{Jackson2022}. We will develop automatic workflows which scan the web continually scan the web to detect images of coconut palms with CRB feeding damage symptoms.
